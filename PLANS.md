# Plans for AxolotlPlus
This is a small project that I made some time ago... I won't update it often but I will update every major update like 1-18, 1-19 and so on. There will also be updates if anything new is added or changed about axolotls. I will list every planned update I have below (probably won't make any of them but who knows?) Just so you know, this won't be on curseforge until 1.5 Beta.




## List of Planned Updates (JE & BE)

- **Version 1.2 Beta**, *probably for 1.18.2 or something.*
- **Version 1.3 Beta**, *might have custom models for bucket and axolotl.* 
- **Version 1.4 Beta**, *probably for updating purposes only, for 1.19 or something.*
- **Version 1.5 Beta**, *most likely last version, adding final touches like better textures, more varied colors and shapes of axolotls, just giving the true PLUS feel.*
