# Axolotl Plus

### AFTER BETA 1.1, [FAITHFUL x32](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/faithful-team) TEXTURES WONT BE USED, INSTEAD BETA 1.2 AND LATER WILL USE [COMPLIANCE 32x](https://compliancepack.net/). HERE IS [WHY](https://github.com/ThatBaratieCook/ThatBaratieCook/blob/axolotlplus/COMPLIANCEUSE.md).

Revamps the *"alright"* textures of the axolotls! These cute little axolotls deserve more justice, therefore the creation (and continuation) of this revamp of the axolotls. This texture pack contains higher-res textures spefically to be used with compliance (or faithful, if you *really* want to.) Please enjoy this creation and please share it (if you want to.)

# Important Information

### The Moving of this Repository
Well... It's pretty simple. This was moved to give a fresh start for the project, and to make the project better, therefore proving it as a more worthy pack of existence. As most people (or me and ZachyFrackyStudios), creating something that is undeserving of its existence (like a crappy, copied, thrown-around s!!tpost pack). That was the status of the pack before, but moving it and revamping it makes it more of its existence :)

## Plans

This is a small project that I made some time ago... I won't update it often but I will update every major update like 1-18, 1-19 and so on. There will also be updates if anything new is added or changed about axolotls. I will list every planned update I have below (probably won't make any of them but who knows?) Just so you know, this won't be on curseforge until 1.5 Beta.




##### List of Planned Updates (JE & BE)

- **Version 1.2 Beta**, *probably for 1.18.2 or something.*
- **Version 1.3 Beta**, *might have custom models for bucket and axolotl.* 
- **Version 1.4 Beta**, *probably for updating purposes only, for 1.19 or something.*
- **Version 1.5 Beta**, *most likely last version, adding final touches like better textures, more varied colors and shapes of axolotls, just giving the true PLUS feel.*
